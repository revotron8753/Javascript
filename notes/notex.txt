# {} this is known as scope

# this. works only in objects not in function

# if{paranthese is used Return statement is must} explicit return
or else while using () => arrow function return statement needs not to be used implicit return

# Execution context:
  1. global execution ------> this
  2. Memory Phase -------> Memory Allocation
  3. Execution Phase ------> Values Defined and real execution occurs (Returns value to global execution) 
     (creates a new sandbox for every function and deletes it once after the job is done)
     Lifo is applicable when nesting of functions is done

# 1. for(of) loop is used to iterate in maps (gives value)
  2. for(in) loop are used to iterate in objects (gives keys) we cannot iterate over maps using in loop
  3. foreach uses function method to get access to value and
  is used to fetch values of array of objects(db's)

# Filter:-
  Eg.(const userBooks = books.filter( (bkl) => bkl.genre === 'History'))
